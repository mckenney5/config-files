Config-Files

- Desc
	This is a collection of my .config files used accross all of my boxes.
	Most (if not all) my boxes run a debian based system. Only my .bashrc
	is OS dependent, and even so can easily be modified for other distros.
	Do not expect anything from this repo. These files are for me to use
	and for you to do what you want with. No merge requests will be accepted.

- How to install
	Simply copy all files from 'src/' to your home directory.
	[optional] copy all files from 'bin/' to your home directory (only
	needed by my tmux config file so parse acpi and cpu temp)

	Or you can run the install.sh script but BE WARNED, any config file
	with the same name as the one on this repo WILL BE OVERWRITTEN

- License and Copyright
	These config files are released as open domian. Go crazy.
	[Note] The .bashrc file contains code that was auto-generated from
		Debian GNU/Linux's bash.
	[Note] The i3/* files contains some code that was auto-generated by i3wm
	[Note] The font/webawesome* font is owned by its repsective owener (who is not me)
