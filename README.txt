Config-Files

- Desc
	This is a collection of my .config files used accross all of my boxes.
	Most (if not all) my boxes run a debian based system. Only my .bashrc
	is OS dependent, and even so can easily be modified for other distros.
	Do not expect anything from this repo. These files are for me to use
	and for you to do what you want with. No merge requests will be accepted.

- How to install
	Simply run `make install` and follow any prompts.

- License and Copyright
	These config files are released as open domian (see LICENSE) except for bellow:
	[Note] The .bashrc file contains code that was auto-generated from
		Debian GNU/Linux's bash.
	[Note] The i3/* files contains some code that was auto-generated by i3wm
	[Note] The font/webawesome* font is owned by its respective owner (who is not me)
